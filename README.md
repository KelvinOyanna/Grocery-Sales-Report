This project was carried out to understand the factors influencing sales over a period of 5 years. The data used was from a grocery store 
that captures all the different categories of product and their respective sales. A visualization dashboard was built to unearth the trend
in sales. 
The product category, customer segment and customer region/location were used to drill-down the report.
